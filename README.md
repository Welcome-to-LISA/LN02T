# LN02T
What is it?
----------- 

This is a dataset produced by our team.The LN-02T dataset is collected from hyperspectral payload and multispectral payload of ZY1-02D including two sets of MSI and HSI on March 19, 2022 and May 13, 2022, September 06, 2022 and October 22, 2022. The LN-02T dataset based on the LN-02 dataset located in Liaohe estuary, Panjin City, Liaoning Province, China cropped the  pixels (hyperspectral image) region to ensure region integrity to reflect the dual temporal variation. We selected 79 bands from hyperspectral images corresponding to the 8 bands of multispectral images. The HSI dimension of this data is (532, 532, 79) and the MSI dimension is (1596, 1596, 8).
